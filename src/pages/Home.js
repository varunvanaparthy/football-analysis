            <p id="abstract-body">Football is a globally popular team sport that relies heavily on teamwork, game plans, and strategies. Effective planning and strategic decision-making in football require accurate statistics and analysis, which in turn rely on comprehensive reports. The goal of this project is to create an Analysis & Reporting System for Football, which generates a variety of reports to analyze both club and individual player performance. These reports include insights on top performers, foul makers, club's win/loss ratio, and more. The system collects data on various attributes such as country, goals scored, penalties, wins, position, and league. Additionally, countries are further categorized into regions such as Europe and South-America for in-depth regional analysis.</p>
